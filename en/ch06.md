4. Split extract articles in following ratio: 80%:10%:10% = train:valid:test and save them into files `train.txt`, `valid.txt` and `test.txt` respectively. In each file, single line should contain single instance. Each instance contain category name and the article headline in a tab separated manner.

After creating the dataset, check the number of instances contained in each **category**.
