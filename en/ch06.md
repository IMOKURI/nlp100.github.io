In this chapter, we tackle the task of news classification.
The task is to classify a given news headline to one of following categories: "Business", "Science", "Entertainment" and "Health."
[News Aggregator Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/News+Aggregator) provided by Fabio Gasparetti, is the dataset we use in this chapter.

## 50. Download and Preprocess Dataset
Download [News Aggregator Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/News+Aggregator) and create training data (`train.txt`), validation data (`valid.txt`) and test data (`test.txt`) as follows:

1. Unpack the downloaded zip file and read `readme.txt`
2. Extract the articles such that the publisher is one of the followings: "Reuters", "Huffington Post", "Businessweek", "Contactmusic.com" and "Daily Mail"
3. Randomly shuffle the extracted articles
4. Split the extracted articles in following ratio: the training data (80%), the validation data (10%) and the test data (10%). Then save them into files `train.txt`, `valid.txt` and `test.txt` respectively. In each file, each line should contain single instance. Each instance should contain both the name of the category and the article headline. Use `Tab` to separate each field.

After creating the dataset, check the number of instances contained in each **category**.
